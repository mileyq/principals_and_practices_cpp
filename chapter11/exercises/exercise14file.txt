Specializations

The standard library provides a specialization of std::vector for the type bool, which may be optimized for space efficiency.
vector<bool>
	space-efficient dynamic bitset
(class template specialization)
Iterator invalidation
	This section is incomplete

There are still a few inaccuracies in this section. Refer to individual member function pages for more detail.
Operations 	Invalidated
All read only operations, swap, std::swap 	Never
clear, operator=, assign 	Always
reserve, shrink_to_fit 	If the vector changed capacity, all of them. If not, none.
erase 	Erased elements + all elements after them (including end())
push_back, emplace_back 	If the vector changed capacity, all of them. If not, only end().
insert, emplace, resize 	If the vector changed capacity, all of them. If not, only those after the insertion point.
pop_back 	The element erased and end().
